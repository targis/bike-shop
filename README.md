# Bike shop
The IT Nation 2.0 Front-end course project. It's a bicycle shop web app page created using React.
In this project, I have created components such as a slider, order constructor, order form, and status check form.


## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run the following:


### `npm start`

It runs the app in development mode.
